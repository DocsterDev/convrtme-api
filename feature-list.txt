Feature Backlog

In backend retry the video search (limit 3 times) if necessary (If Json doesnt load correctly) - DONE
Extract data from youtube json in backend that way we can log an error if we arent able to parse it correctly - DONE
Ability to pick up a video from here they left off (the technological impacts of keeping user play data updated) - TODO: thinking of keeping this data in cache and update the database in batch every 5 minutes?? and the invalidating the cache after 20 minutes of inactivity
Ability to add users and keep track of different devices they are on

Pre-load video urls asyncly while video list is loading (that way we can grey-out the videos that are not available (or not show them at all - this also may be a good time to indicate if there is an audio only url or not) )
Loading spinner when video urls are loading in results list - Optional - may be overwhelming - Maybe have it in one place until all are loaded?
Ability to alert user when file is too big (or there is no audio only url) - We could add an indicator in the results list if this is the case

Indicator list:
File too big
Video only url
Cant be loaded / is a music video (or simply dont show it in list)

Back back log
Add ability to add play lists (figure out defining features such as how a user can access the different play lists)
Would be cool to keep track of how much data is downloaded in total - how the F can we do this??
Ability to configure in settings what file size to alert
Ability to collapse / expand bottom player
